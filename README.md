# WebDevCourse-Hourly-1
This is a submission for my web development course assignment 1.

Instruction on how to run:
Before running the servers please make sure that you have node installed and you have .env files in both frontend folder and backend folder.

The structure for your backend .env file should be:
- DB_URI=*mongodb uri*
- JWT_SECRET=*jwt secret*
- JWT_EXPIRE=*expire time*

The structure for your frontend .env file should be:
- REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000

1) From your terminal go to both frontend and backend folder and type npm install to install the node dependencies.
2) Once done installation, go to each terminal and type npm start to start the servers.
